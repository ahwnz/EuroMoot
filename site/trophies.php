      <h3>Fergus McLaren Banner</h3>
      <p>
        The other “big one.” Initially awarded for camping standards at Moot, but

        Fergus McLaren, who was an Otago Rover killed in the Second World War,
        is documented in the book “Fergus McLaren” which accompanies the banner.
        This provides an understanding of the true meaning behind the banner.
